# Sakura

A Flask-based web application that leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence to allow users to create, understand, and debug Python code.

## Description

We wanted to create a program that would help individuals better understand computer programming (Python, in particular) through a user-friendly and accessible interface.

Our project was created on Flask, a python-based web framework. This allowed us a simple back-end framework where we could call our API while also maintaining a dynamic front-end site for users. Additionally, we were able to leverage the ability to send information from client-side to server-side to enhance a user's experience.

What's next for Sakura
Next, learning how APIs can significantly elevate and automate our day-to-day lives is something that proved to be fascinating as it showed us what computer programming would be capable of, both now, and late into the future. Up next, Sakura would like to include more advanced features, such as taking into account different programming languages, other than Python, for debugging, generating, and explaining.
